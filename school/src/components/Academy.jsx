                  St. Joseph English Academy School was founded with a mission to produce skilled middle-level health professionals ready for immediate employment, especially in rural areas. The institution emphasizes comprehensive healthcare trainingâ€”covering preventive, promotive, curative, managerial, and rehabilitative care.

                  HVTC offers a range of CTEVT-affiliated and nationally recognized programs, including the Proficiency Certificate Level in Nursing (since 2002), General Medicine (Health Assistant, since 2003), Diploma in Pharmacy (since 2004), and the newly launched Caregiver Program.

                  To support inclusive education and academic excellence, HVTC offers scholarships to deserving students. Three scholarships are awarded annually to students from Category 3, as designated by CTEVT, to promote diversity and support underrepresented backgrounds. Additionally, a merit-based scholarship is granted each year to recognize outstanding academic performance. Through these initiatives, HVTC reinforces its commitment to accessible, high-quality healthcare education and the development of compassionate, competent professionals.
